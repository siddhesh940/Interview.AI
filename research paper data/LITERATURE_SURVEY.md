II. LITERATURE SURVEY

Artificial intelligence-based interview preparation systems have significantly advanced career guidance and skill development, emphasizing accurate skill assessment and personalized feedback mechanisms.[1] The integration of real-time voice analysis and emotion detection using machine learning models has enhanced interview simulation platforms, improving response accuracy and user engagement.[2] Systems designed for mock interview practice utilize AI-powered analytics for improved situational awareness and adaptive feedback generation.[3] Candidate assessment using AI-equipped platforms with behavior recognition capabilities has improved preparation outcomes, aiding skill development and confidence building.[4] Additionally, extracting comprehensive candidate profiles through resume parsing and NLP techniques enhances interview feedback quality and personalization.[5] Finally, platforms integrated with speech analysis assist in communication assessment, improving overall reliability in interview performance evaluation.[6] These advancements collectively strengthen AI applications in interview preparation, career guidance, and skill assessment.

“AI Powered Mock Interview System with Real-Time Voice Analysis” R. Umbare, A. Budhodkar (2025) [1]:
This paper presents an AI-powered mock interview system that focuses on analyzing voice responses during simulated interviews to assess confidence, clarity, and response quality. The system enhances interview realism by providing automated feedback based on speech patterns and response evaluation. It helps candidates gain awareness of their verbal communication performance. However, the system is primarily limited to interview simulation and does not include structured aptitude training, resume analysis, or company-specific interview preparation. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses these limitations by integrating interview simulation with resume-based skill analysis, aptitude practice, and structured preparation resources aligned with real recruitment requirements.

“A Comprehensive Study and Implementation of Mock Interview Simulator with AI and Pose-Based Interaction” B. Jadhav, A. Sawant (2024) [2]: This paper presents a deep learning-based mock interview simulator that combines speech analysis with pose-based interaction to evaluate behavioral aspects during interviews. The system focuses on gesture analysis and communication behavior to enhance presentation and soft skills. By incorporating pose-based interaction, the platform attempts to provide detailed behavioral feedback to candidates. However, the system requires high computational resources and lacks flexibility for large-scale usage on standard devices, which limits its accessibility. In contrast, the proposed Interview.ai system emphasizes web-based accessibility and scalability by providing AI-powered interview simulations, structured feedback, and soft skills improvement modules that can be accessed through standard web browsers without the need for specialized hardware.

“AI-Driven Virtual Mock Interview Development” P. Mishra, A. Arulappan (2024) [3]: In this research work, the authors utilize Natural Language Processing techniques to assess the tone, clarity, and structure of interview responses in virtual mock interviews. The system generates adaptive, domain-specific questions and provides feedback aimed at improving communication skills and interview confidence. While the approach enhances realism and adaptability, the effectiveness of response evaluation largely depends on data quality and predefined sentiment models. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses this limitation by combining interview simulations with interactive skill development activities, aptitude practice, and structured feedback mechanisms, thereby supporting overall interview readiness beyond response sentiment analysis.

“A Survey of AI-Driven Mock Interviews using GenAI and Machine Learning (InterviewX)” J. Barpute, O. Wattamwar (2024) [4]:
This survey analyzes various AI-driven mock interview systems that employ generative AI and machine learning techniques for automated question generation and interview evaluation. The study highlights the scalability and adaptability of large language models in delivering personalized interview experiences. However, the surveyed systems often involve high computational costs and complex infrastructure requirements, which limit their practical deployment in academic environments. The Interview.ai system overcomes these challenges by utilizing cloud-based AI services and efficient web technologies to deliver scalable interview preparation, resume analysis, and placement readiness features without heavy infrastructure dependency.

“An AI Mock-Interview Platform for Interview Performance Analysis” Y.-C. Chou, F. Wongso (2022) [5]: This study introduces an AI-based mock interview platform designed to simulate real-time interview scenarios and provide automated performance evaluation. The system applies machine learning techniques to deliver instant feedback, improving candidate engagement and self-assessment. Although effective in interview simulation, the platform offers limited holistic preparation, as it does not integrate aptitude training, resume analysis, or structured soft skills development. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses these limitations by offering a comprehensive preparation environment that includes resume-based skill identification, aptitude assessment, soft skills enhancement, and overall performance analytics to support complete interview and career readiness.
