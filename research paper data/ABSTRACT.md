# ABSTRACT

The increasing complexity of modern recruitment processes has made interview preparation significantly more demanding, while traditional preparation methods remain fragmented and insufficient to address individual candidate needs. This paper presents an AI-driven career preparation platform that integrates automated resume parsing, interview simulation, and comprehensive career readiness assessment within a unified system. The platform analyzes user-uploaded resumes to extract skills, education, projects, and professional experience, identifying gaps by aligning candidate profiles with target job roles. To address a critical challenge where technically capable candidates often fail HR rounds, the system introduces an AI-powered HR Interview Coach that prepares users for behavioral, situational, and personality-based questions through structured practice and feedback. In addition, a Technical Interview Practice Engine is incorporated to strengthen technical readiness across core domains such as data structures, databases, operating systems, object-oriented programming, and programming languages using theory-based questions, coding challenges, follow-up questioning, and debugging tasks. The platform further includes aptitude training, soft skill development, gamified learning modules, company-specific preparation resources, and placement tracking features. Adaptive feedback and analytics-driven insights enable personalized learning paths, reducing preparation time while improving confidence and interview performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates improved role readiness and interview outcomes, making the system effective for students, job seekers, and educational institutions.
