## 2.1 Related Work

Related work in the domain of AI-powered interview preparation and career guidance includes a variety of existing software solutions, academic research studies, and industry platforms developed to support job seekers during recruitment processes. Several web-based interview preparation systems provide mock interviews, aptitude tests, and basic learning resources to help candidates improve their interview performance. Some platforms also incorporate artificial intelligence techniques for resume screening, skill extraction, and automated feedback generation. However, these systems are generally limited to isolated functionalities and often fail to provide a comprehensive and personalized assessment of a candidate’s overall interview readiness. Academic research has explored the application of machine learning and natural language processing techniques for resume parsing, interview response evaluation, and skill assessment, primarily focusing on predefined metrics and textual analysis. Industry reports and market studies indicate a growing adoption of digital interview preparation tools, driven by increasing competition and demand for efficient placement readiness solutions. Despite this growth, existing platforms lack seamless integration of resume analysis, interview simulation, aptitude assessment, behavioral interview coaching, technical practice, and career guidance within a unified system. These limitations highlight the need for an intelligent and integrated interview preparation platform that can deliver structured feedback, identify individual skill gaps, and align preparation strategies with real-world job requirements, forming the foundation for the proposed Interview.ai system.

“AI Powered Mock Interview System with Real-Time Voice Analysis” (2025) 
This paper presents an AI-powered mock interview system that focuses on analyzing voice responses during simulated interviews to assess confidence, clarity, and response quality. The system enhances interview realism by providing automated feedback based on speech patterns and response evaluation. It helps candidates gain awareness of their verbal communication performance. However, the system is primarily limited to interview simulation and does not include structured aptitude training, resume analysis, or company-specific interview preparation. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses these limitations by integrating interview simulation with resume-based skill analysis, aptitude practice, and structured preparation resources aligned with real recruitment requirements.

“A Comprehensive Study and Implementation of Mock Interview Simulator with AI and Pose-Based Interaction” (2024) 
This paper presents a deep learning-based mock interview simulator that combines speech analysis with pose-based interaction to evaluate behavioral aspects during interviews. The system focuses on gesture analysis and communication behavior to enhance presentation and soft skills. By incorporating pose-based interaction, the platform attempts to provide detailed behavioral feedback to candidates. However, the system requires high computational resources and lacks flexibility for large-scale usage on standard devices, which limits its accessibility. In contrast, the proposed Interview.ai system emphasizes web-based accessibility and scalability by providing AI-powered interview simulations, structured feedback, and soft skills improvement modules that can be accessed through standard web browsers without the need for specialized hardware.

“AI-Driven Virtual Mock Interview Development” (2024) 
In this research work, the authors utilize Natural Language Processing techniques to assess the tone, clarity, and structure of interview responses in virtual mock interviews. The system generates adaptive, domain-specific questions and provides feedback aimed at improving communication skills and interview confidence. While the approach enhances realism and adaptability, the effectiveness of response evaluation largely depends on data quality and predefined sentiment models. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses this limitation by combining interview simulations with interactive skill development activities, aptitude practice, and structured feedback mechanisms, thereby supporting overall interview readiness beyond response sentiment analysis.

“A Survey of AI-Driven Mock Interviews using GenAI and Machine Learning (InterviewX)” (2024) 
This survey analyzes various AI-driven mock interview systems that employ generative AI and machine learning techniques for automated question generation and interview evaluation. The study highlights the scalability and adaptability of large language models in delivering personalized interview experiences. However, the surveyed systems often involve high computational costs and complex infrastructure requirements, which limit their practical deployment in academic environments. The Interview.ai system overcomes these challenges by utilizing cloud-based AI services and efficient web technologies to deliver scalable interview preparation, resume analysis, and placement readiness features without heavy infrastructure dependency.

“An AI Mock-Interview Platform for Interview Performance Analysis” (2022) 
This study introduces an AI-based mock interview platform designed to simulate real-time interview scenarios and provide automated performance evaluation. The system applies machine learning techniques to deliver instant feedback, improving candidate engagement and self-assessment. Although effective in interview simulation, the platform offers limited holistic preparation, as it does not integrate aptitude training, resume analysis, or structured soft skills development. The proposed Interview.ai system addresses these limitations by offering a comprehensive preparation environment that includes resume-based skill identification, aptitude assessment, soft skills enhancement, and overall performance analytics to support complete interview and career readiness.


                The review of existing interview preparation and mock interview systems indicates that most current solutions focus on limited aspects of the recruitment process such as interview simulation or basic response evaluation. Many platforms rely on predefined questions and generic feedback, offering minimal personalization and incomplete assessment of candidate readiness. Existing systems often lack integration of resume analysis, aptitude training, structured soft skills development, and placement-oriented preparation within a single platform. Additionally, dependency on high computational resources or advanced infrastructure reduces accessibility for large-scale student usage. These limitations highlight the need for an integrated and scalable AI-powered interview preparation system that provides comprehensive assessment, personalized feedback, and end-to-end career readiness support, which forms the foundation for the proposed Interview.ai system.

## 2.3 Problem Statement

The growing competition in the job market and continuously evolving industry expectations have made interview preparation and placement readiness a significant challenge for students and job seekers. The lack of a centralized and intelligent interview preparation platform leads to fragmented learning, limited personalization, and ineffective tracking of individual progress. Educational institutions and placement cells face difficulties in monitoring student readiness, identifying skill gaps, and providing timely, role-specific guidance. Existing interview preparation approaches largely depend on generic study materials, manual evaluations, and isolated tools, which fail to deliver structured feedback and comprehensive career support. Moreover, most current platforms do not adequately address behavioral interview preparation or hands-on technical skill practice, resulting in candidates being underprepared for both HR and technical interview rounds. This gap between preparation methods and real-world interview requirements often leads to poor performance and unsuccessful placement outcomes. Hence, there is a clear need for an AI-powered interview preparation system that integrates resume analysis, interview simulation, aptitude assessment, behavioral interview coaching, technical practice, and skill development within a single digital platform to enhance personalized preparation, improve progress tracking, and increase overall placement effectiveness in the education sector.
