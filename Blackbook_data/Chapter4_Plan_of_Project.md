## 4.1 Methodology

The AI-powered Interview Preparation System is designed to provide a structured and intelligent approach to interview readiness and career preparation. The methodology begins with user registration, where students create profiles by providing basic academic details, career interests, and target job roles. Once registered, users upload their resumes, which are analyzed to extract skills, experience, and educational information. Based on this data, the system identifies skill gaps and recommends relevant preparation modules. The platform then enables users to participate in AI-driven mock interviews, aptitude practice sessions, behavioral interview coaching, technical practice assessments, and soft skill development activities. During interview simulations, user responses are evaluated and structured feedback is generated to improve communication, confidence, and technical clarity. All user interactions and performance data are stored in a centralized database, allowing continuous tracking of progress. The system also provides company-specific preparation resources and placement readiness insights. This integrated methodology ensures personalized guidance, efficient preparation management, and improved interview performance.

**Figure 4.1.1: Process Flow of Interview Preparation System (User)**

In Figure 4.1.1, the comprehensive user journey begins when a registered user logs into the Interview.ai platform. The user checks profile information, uploads resume, and sets target career roles. The platform offers multiple pathways for skill development and career preparation. Users can utilize the Resume Builder feature to create professional resumes using AI-powered templates and formatting suggestions. Based on extracted profile data, the system recommends suitable preparation modules including AI-driven mock interviews, aptitude tests, behavioral interview coaching, technical practice assessments, soft skill development activities, and interactive games for interview preparation. During mock interviews, user responses are recorded with real-time facial analysis and evaluated for content relevance, clarity, and confidence. The system provides detailed feedback and improvement suggestions, allowing users to track their progress through performance analytics. Advanced features include the Dream Company Station for target-specific preparation and Time Machine for career prediction and roadmap generation. Users can apply to eligible Placement Drives based on their preparation level and academic qualifications. The notification system keeps users informed about new opportunities, updates, and drive announcements. All user interactions and performance data are continuously stored and analyzed, enabling personalized guidance and comprehensive preparation management until users achieve interview readiness and career success.

**Figure 4.1.2: Process Flow of AI Interview Simulation**

Figure 4.1.2 illustrates the comprehensive workflow of the AI interview simulation module. The process begins when a user initiates the AI Interview Simulation. The system intelligently selects role-based questions tailored to the user's target role and current preparation level, supporting both technical interview scenarios and behavioral HR interview coaching sessions. During the interview session, user responses are recorded through video and audio capture with real-time facial analysis to assess confidence, engagement, and communication patterns. The AI engine evaluates responses across multiple dimensions including content relevance, technical accuracy, behavioral competency, clarity of expression, and overall confidence levels. After each session, structured feedback is provided in a detailed format, highlighting specific strengths and pinpointing areas requiring improvement in both technical knowledge and soft skills. Based on the feedback, users have three strategic options: they can retry the interview session with new questions to practice further, study suggested topics and practice modules including HR interview coaching and technical practice assessments to address identified weaknesses, or advance to more sophisticated preparation stages if performance meets standards. The system continuously tracks and updates performance metrics with detailed analytics, stores all interaction data in the database for progress tracking, and maintains continuous performance monitoring to ensure sustained skill improvement. This iterative and adaptive process creates a personalized learning loop that helps users systematically improve their interview performance through repeated evaluation, targeted feedback, and progressive skill development.

**Figure 4.1.3: Process Flow of Career Readiness and Placement Preparation**

In Figure 4.1.3, the system focuses on overall career readiness and placement preparation. The platform aggregates data from resume analysis, interview simulations, aptitude assessments, HR interview coaching sessions, technical practice assessments, and soft skill activities to generate a comprehensive readiness score. Based on this score, users receive company-specific preparation guidance and role-based recommendations. Users with high scores (≥80%) proceed directly to placement insights, while those with medium (60-79%) or low (<60%) scores receive targeted improvement suggestions through HR coaching and technical practice modules. Placement-related insights and preparation progress are continuously updated in the database, ensuring that users remain aligned with industry expectations. This process supports informed decision-making and efficient placement preparation.

## 4.3 Proposed System

The proposed system architecture for "Interview.ai" is built on a modern, scalable multi-layered design that seamlessly integrates advanced AI technologies with robust web infrastructure. The architecture follows a hierarchical flow starting from the **Users Layer**, where candidates interact with the platform through an intuitive interface. User authentication is handled by the **Authentication Layer** powered by Clerk Auth, providing secure Sign Up, Session Management, and OAuth integration capabilities.

The **Frontend Layer** is developed using Next.js 14, React 18, and TypeScript, ensuring a responsive, type-safe, and performant user experience. This layer communicates with the **API Layer**, which implements REST API endpoints, Next-SecRoot middleware for security, and Next.js API Routes for server-side operations.

The **Backend Layer** comprises five core modules: **Dashboard** (Home & Activity tracking), **Resume Builder** (Upload & Export PDF), **AI Interview Selection** (AI-powered interview simulations with Retell AI integration), **Practice Modules** (Screening & Coding assessments), and the newly integrated **HR Interview Coach** (Soft Skills & STAR Method coaching). Each module is designed to provide specialized functionality while maintaining seamless integration with the overall system.

At the heart of the system lies the **AI Engine Layer**, which consists of three powerful sub-systems:
1. **Core Services** - Resume Service (Parse PDF, OCR), Practice Service (Default, TTS), Feedback Service (Score, Report), and Interview Notifications
2. **AI Engine** - Multiple OpenAI integrations including Voice STI + NLP, GPT-4 + Fine-tuning, GPT-4 + NLP, and Multi-Model Remnoad Scoring for comprehensive response evaluation
3. **Technical Practice Engine (NEW)** - Code Execution with Dynamic Output Evaluation, and DSA Patterns including SQL & Regex Challenges

The second AI processing tier includes the **Data Engine** (OpenAI GPT-4 + Fine-Tuning, Ratinee XRPL GPT-4 + Recommendation) and the **HRC Engine** for HR Interview Coach analysis (Soft Skills + NBP, Interview Auth + Analysis).

The **Data Layer** provides persistent storage through Supabase PostgreSQL database, organized into four categories: **Core Tables** (Resume, Auth, Scores), **Result Tables** (Questions, Answer Responses, Analysis Ranking, Feedback), **TPE Data** (Chatfriants Response Store, Past Attempts, SQL/Sulutions), and **Storage** for file management.

The **External Services Layer** integrates with third-party providers: **Vercel** (Hosting, Voice, Edge CDN), **Clerk Auth** (Storage & Authentication), and **Retell AI** (Voice & WebSocket real-time communication).

In Figure 4.3.1, this comprehensive system architecture represents a paradigm shift in interview preparation management. By harnessing multiple AI models (OpenAI GPT-4, NLP, Voice STI) and modern web technologies (Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript), the platform delivers personalized, adaptive learning experiences. The HR Interview Coach module provides dedicated behavioral interview preparation with STAR method coaching and scenario-based soft skills practice, while the Technical Practice Engine offers code execution environments with real-time evaluation, DSA pattern challenges, SQL queries, and regex problem-solving capabilities. This integrated architecture enables educational institutions to enhance student engagement, improve career readiness, optimize placement management, and respond swiftly to industry requirements, ultimately achieving higher placement success rates.
