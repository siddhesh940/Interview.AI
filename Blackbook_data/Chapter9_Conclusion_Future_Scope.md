Practical evaluation shows measurable improvement in confidence, response clarity, and interview performance through repeated usage. The platform successfully bridges the gap between academic knowledge and industry expectations by providing adaptive feedback and realistic interview simulation. Overall, Interview.ai proves to be an effective, scalable, and accessible solution for enhancing placement readiness, with strong potential for future expansion through deeper behavioral analysis and industry-focused customization.

## 9.2 Limitations

1. Response Time: One limitation of this system is the response time during AI-powered voice interviews, which refers to the time taken for the AI model to process speech input, generate feedback, and respond back to the user in real-time.

2. Internet Dependency: The platform requires a stable internet connection for real-time voice interviews, AI question generation, and accessing cloud-based services, which may limit usability in low-connectivity areas.

## 9.3 Future Scope

The future scope of the Interview.ai platform includes enhancing AI models for more accurate voice, facial expression, and emotion analysis to improve feedback quality. Additional features such as deeper behavioral analysis, adaptive interview difficulty, and advanced company-specific interview customization can be introduced. The system can also be extended to support multi-user profiles, enabling personalized career tracking for different roles and goals. Further integration of learning analytics and real-time performance insights will help users track long-term progress more effectively. These enhancements will make Interview.ai a more intelligent, scalable, and comprehensive career preparation platform.
