## Brief about the Idea:

Interview.ai is an AI-powered interview preparation platform that helps students and job seekers prepare for campus placements and job interviews. The platform uses OpenAI GPT-4o to conduct real-time voice-enabled mock interviews, generate adaptive follow-up questions, and provide detailed performance feedback. It covers all aspects of placement preparation including technical interviews (DSA, DBMS, OS, OOP, CN), HR behavioral interviews with sentiment and facial expression analysis, aptitude practice (quantitative, reasoning, verbal), ATS-friendly resume building with AI skill extraction, and company-specific preparation for major recruiters like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, and Accenture. The system personalizes the experience by analyzing the user's resume to generate relevant questions and tracks progress through an analytics dashboard. Built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase PostgreSQL, and Retell AI, the platform aims to democratize quality interview coaching for students across Bharat — making it accessible, affordable, and available to everyone regardless of their location or financial background.
