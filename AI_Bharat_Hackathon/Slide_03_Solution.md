### How different is it from any of the other existing ideas?

Unlike existing platforms such as InterviewBit, Pramp, or MockAI that offer only text-based question banks or pre-recorded video practice, Interview.ai provides **real-time AI voice-enabled mock interviews** powered by GPT-4o and Retell AI. The platform doesn't just ask questions — it listens to your voice response, understands it, and generates intelligent follow-up questions just like a real interviewer would. Additionally, it combines **technical + HR + aptitude + resume + company-specific preparation** all in one platform, whereas competitors focus on only one aspect. The HR Coach module with **facial expression and sentiment analysis** is a unique feature not found in any existing free platform targeting Indian students.

### How will it be able to solve the problem?

Interview.ai solves the placement readiness problem by giving every student access to unlimited AI-powered mock interviews anytime, anywhere. Instead of depending on expensive coaching or limited college placement cells, students can practice real-time voice interviews, get instant AI-generated feedback with scoring across multiple dimensions (technical accuracy, communication, confidence), identify weak areas through analytics, and improve iteratively. The platform covers all placement rounds — technical, HR, aptitude — so students don't need multiple tools. Resume analysis ensures interview questions are personalized to the student's actual skill set, making practice highly relevant and effective.
